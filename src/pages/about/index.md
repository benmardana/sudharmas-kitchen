My mum, Sue, is the the best cook in the world. Of course, as her daughter, I may be biased. But the countless number of times I've heard folk from all over the globe (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK, Denmark, China, Thailand, the Netherlands... AND Sri Lanka) sit at our dining table, clean their plates, lick their lips and rub their full bellies - proving that, time and time again, Mum's recipes are classics. Sri Lankan food is uniquely personal to the home cook: there is never a \"standard\" recipe. Growing up in Australia, I've watched my\
mum tailor and tweak her recipes to suit many different palates, and this blog is a summary of my personal favourites.

### Two Sri Lankan vets living in regional Australia

More than 30 years ago, my parents (as two young Sri Lankan veterinarians), moved to Perth - Australia. They soon found themselves in the middle of regional W.A. (Katanning), renting a property on a farm, with a baby and a naughty Kelpie called Danny. We then moved around a lot to various agricultural town centres in regional Victoria and South Australia. 

My mum loves to cook - and not just Sri Lankan (she makes a mean Sunday Pork Roast, and duck confit). I was born and raised as an Australian, and as many young first generation Australians, rebelled against the Sri Lankan dishes mum would lovingly prepare for me. I wanted to fit in - so beef steak and potatoes was my most often request. Thankfully, I soon grew to love my Sri Lankan heritage (and all of the food that goes with it) - and this site hopes to play homage to it. 

### Key principles for Sri Lankan cooking

Sri Lankan cooking is forgiving. There is a reason that there is no "standard" recipe for many Sri Lankan dishes. This is because, more often than not, it is all about personal taste - and flexing a dish to its planned accompaniments (or even guests)! Your guests don't like spicy food? No dramas, just go easy on the chilli (or do two versions). Prefer a vegan lifestyle? No worries, just stick with those veggie dishes with coconut milk. Sri Lankan dishes are often simple and efficient to make - so you can do your own recipe testing to fine-tune them to your taste.
