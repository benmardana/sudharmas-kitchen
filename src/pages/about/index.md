### Two Sri Lankan vets living in regional Australia
More than 30 years ago, my parents (as two young Sri Lankan veterinarians), moved to Perth - Australia. They soon found themselves in the middle of regional W.A. (Katanning), renting a property on a farm, with a baby and a naughty Kelpie called Danny. We then moved around a lot to various agricultural town centres in regional Victoria and South Australia. 

My mum loves to cook - and not just Sri Lankan (she makes a mean Sunday Pork Roast, and duck confit). I was born and raised as an Australian, and as many young first generation Australians, rebelled against the Sri Lankan dishes mum would lovingly prepare for me. I wanted to fit in - so beef steak and potatoes was my most often request. Thankfully, I soon grew to love my Sri Lankan heritage (and all of the food that goes with it) - and this site hopes to play homage to it. 

### Key principles for Sri Lankan cooking
Sri Lankan cooking is forgiving. There is a reason that there is no "standard" recipe for many Sri Lankan dishes. This is because, more often than not, it is all about personal taste - and flexing a dish to its planned accompaniments (or even guests)! Your guests don't like spicy food? No dramas, just go easy on the chilli (or do two versions). Prefer a vegan lifestyle? No worries, just stick with those veggie dishes with coconut milk. Sri Lankan dishes are often simple and efficient to make - so you can do your own recipe testing to fine-tune them to your taste.
