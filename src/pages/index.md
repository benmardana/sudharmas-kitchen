      text: "My mum, Sue, is the the best cook in the world. Of course, as her
        daughter, I may be biased. But the countless number of times I've heard
        folk from all over the globe (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the
        UK, Denmark, China, Thailand, the Netherlands... AND Sri Lanka) sit at
        our dining table, clean their plates, lick their lips and rub their full
        bellies - proving that, time and time again, Mum's recipes are
        classics.  Sri Lankan food is uniquely personal to the home cook: there
        is never a \"standard\" recipe. Growing up in Australia, I've watched my
        mum tailor and tweak her recipes to suit many different palates, and
        this blog is a summary of my personal favourites. "

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...
