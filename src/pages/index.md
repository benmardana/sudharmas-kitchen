  body: "My mum, Sue, is the the best cook in the world. Of course, as her
    daughter, I may be biased. But the countless number of times I've heard
    folks from all over the globe (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK,
    Denmark, China, Thailand, the Netherlands... AND Sri Lanka) sit at our
    dining table, clean their plates, lick their lips and rub their full bellies
    - proving that, time and time again, Mum's recipes are classics.  Sri Lankan
    food is uniquely personal to the home cook: there is never a \"standard\"
    recipe. Growing up in Australia, I've watched my mum tailor and tweak her
    recipes to suit many different palates, and this blog is a summary of my
    personal favourites."
