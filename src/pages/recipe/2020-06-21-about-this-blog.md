  My mum, Sue, is the the best cook in the world. The countless number of times
  I've heard folk from all over the globe (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,
  the UK, Denmark, China, Thailand, the Netherlands... AND Sri Lanka) sit at our
  dining table, clean their plates, lick their lips and rub their full bellies -
  proving that, time and time again, Mum's recipes are classics.  Sri Lankan
  food is uniquely personal to the home cook: there is never a "standard"
  recipe.

Growing up in Australia, I've watched my mum tailor and tweak her recipes to suit many different palates, and this blog is a summary of my personal favourites.
