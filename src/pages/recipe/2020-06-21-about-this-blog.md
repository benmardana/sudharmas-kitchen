  My mum, Sue, is the the best cook in the world. Of course, as her daughter, I
  may be biased. But the countless number of times I've heard folk from all over
  the globe (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK, Denmark, China,
  Thailand, the Netherlands... AND Sri Lanka) sit at our dining table, clean
  their plates, lick their lips and rub their full bellies - proving that, time
  and time again, Mum's recipes are classics.  Sri Lankan food is uniquely
  personal to the home cook: there is never a "standard" recipe. Growing up in
  Australia, I've watched my mum tailor and tweak her recipes to suit many
  different palates, and this blog is a summary of my personal favourites.
