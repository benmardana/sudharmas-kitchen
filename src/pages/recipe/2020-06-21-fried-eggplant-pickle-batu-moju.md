description: "This \"Batu moju\" (translated as \"eggplant pickle\") brings back
  childhood memories of the delicious smell of a fry-up wafting from my mum's
  kitchen. The balance of salt, sour and sweet, makes this dish impossibly
  moreish, is a perfect side dish for your rice and curry - and is a great
  vegetarian or vegan option. Just try not to pick at all the tasty salty/fried
  eggplant bits as you cook (trust me, it's hard). "

**Serves:** 2-4

**Storage:** Keeps refrigerated for up to one week

**Difficulty and time:** Easy to moderate, 45 minutes

**Ingredients**

*For the fry up*

* 1 kg eggplant, sliced into rounds across the equator, and then into 1 cm wide strips
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 onion, sliced along the equator 
* 6 green chillies, sliced and deseeded (if small, leave as is)
* 1 tablespoon salt
* Vegetable oil (enough to deep fry)
* (Optional) Handful of dried anchovies (Ikan Bilis) - leave out for vegetarian/vegan option
* (Optional) Raw green chilli (sliced) for garnish

*For the pickling sauce*

* 1/3 cup white vinegar
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon chilli powder
* 1/2 teaspoon mustard seed powder
* 3 cloves garlic (minced)
* 1/2 inch ginger (minced)
* Pinch of salt (to taste)

**Method:**

1. Prepare raw ingredients for the fry up.

2. In a large bowl, combine salt, turmeric and eggplant strips until coated. Let rest in a colander for at least 10 minutes to drain some of the liquid.

3. While eggplant is being drained, slowly heat up a wok of oil until hot enough for deep frying. Use a wooden spoon to test temperature of the oil (there should be bubbles). Do not let oil over heat or smoke - this will burn the eggplant. 
4. Once oil is at temperature, fry eggplant in batches (2-4 batches), until golden brown and each piece is beginning to crinkle. Remove each batch into a bowl with paper towel to absorb excess oil. 
5. In the same oil, fry green chillies, and dried anchovy (if using) for 2-5 minutes. Remove from oil and rest in a bowl with paper towel. Then add onion, and fry until brown and crispy, and place in same bowl. 
6. To prepare the pickling sauce, add all pickling ingredients into a large bowl. Combine until sugar and salt is fully dissolved and taste. Pickling sauce should balance salt, sweet and sour - so adjust ingredients as required. 
7. Add all ingredients from the fry up into the bowl of pickling sauce, and gently combine. Rest for 30 mins - 1 hour for the pickle flavours to absorb. 

Serve with rice and curry of your choice. Enjoy!
