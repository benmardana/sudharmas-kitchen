**Serves:** 4

**Storage:** Keeps refrigerated for up to one week

**Difficulty and time:** Easy, 15 minutes

**Ingredients**

*For the pumpkin curry*

* 1/4 large pumpkin, diced
* 1/2 onion, chopped finely 
* 1 green chilli, split length ways and de-seeded
* 1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 
* 1/2 teaspoon raw curry powder
* Few curry leaves
* 1/2 can coconut cream
* Salt to taste

*For the temper*

* 4 tablespoons olive oil 
* 1 pinch black mustard seeds
* Onion (finely sliced) 
* Few curry leaves
* Chilli pieces

**Method:**

1. In a medium-large saucepan, add pumpkin, onion, green chilli, turmeric, raw curry powder, fenugreek seeds, and curry leaves.
2. Cover with water (to just cover the pumpkin), being careful to not add too much. More can be added later if water is not sufficient. 
3. Add salt to taste (at least 1/2 tablespoon).
4. Bring to boil on medium heat.
5. Simmer on medium heat until pumpkin begins to soften, adding water where necessary.  
6. Once liquid has evaporated, stir in coconut milk and take off the heat. Note, it is important to not leave this step too long as the pumpkin will begin to soften too much and disintegrate. 
7. In a separate fry pan, bring olive oil to heat. 
8. Add temper ingredients, and stir until sufficiently fried (watch that the onion does not burn). 
9. Serve pumpkin curry into its serving dish and pour temper on top for garnish. 

Serve with rice and other curries of your choice. Enjoy!
